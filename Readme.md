GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Saigenix/Email-Newsletter

**Overview**
The Free Email Newsletter project is a Node.js-based solution that automates the creation and distribution of email newsletters using GitHub Workflows and Firebase. It provides an efficient way to convert Markdown files into HTML emails and send them to subscribers listed in a Firebase Firestore database.

**Technologies Used**
- Node.js: The project is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows server-side scripting, making it perfect for automating tasks.

- GitHub Workflows: GitHub Workflows are utilized to automate the process of converting Markdown files into HTML emails and sending them to subscribers after each GitHub push.

- Firebase Firestore: Firebase Firestore is used to store and manage the list of email subscribers. It provides a scalable and real-time database solution.

- Nodemailer: Nodemailer is a popular Node.js module used for sending emails. It plays a crucial role in sending out the newsletters to subscribers.

**How It Works**
- Markdown to HTML Conversion: When a new Markdown file is added to the contents directory, the project automatically converts it into HTML format. This ensures that your newsletters are well-formatted and visually appealing.

- Subscriber Management: The project maintains a list of email subscribers in Firebase Firestore. You can easily add, update, or remove subscribers from this database.

- GitHub Workflows: After pushing changes to the GitHub repository, GitHub Workflows are triggered. These workflows handle the Markdown-to-HTML conversion and email distribution process.

**Future Updates**
In future updates, the project aims to enhance the user experience by adding the following features:

- User Interface (UI) for Adding Emails: Users will have an intuitive interface to subscribe to the newsletter by providing their email addresses.

- UI for Adding and Committing New Content: The project will feature a user-friendly UI for creating and committing new newsletter content directly from the interface.

These additions will make the project even more accessible and user-friendly.
